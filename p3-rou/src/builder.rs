//! Building trade route stops, and the format semantics this encodes (all verified
//! against game-saved routes):
//!
//! - Per stop and ware, the operation is encoded by the signs of price and amount:
//!   load office -> ship = price 0, positive amount; unload ship -> office = price 0,
//!   negative amount; sell to town = positive minimum price, positive amount; buy from
//!   town = negated maximum price, positive amount.
//! - Amounts are raw units: in-game units times the ware scaling (loads 2000,
//!   barrels 200, weapons 10). [MAX_AMOUNT] means "as much as possible", unscaled.
//! - The action byte carries the repair flag ([FLAG_R]/[FLAG_X]/[FLAG_NONE]) and
//!   [FIRST_STOP_MARKER] on the route's first stop.
//! - The per-stop order array is the instruction order; [partitioned_order] puts
//!   unloading wares first so the ship frees space before taking new cargo on.
